✅ Import and preprocess the Listings.csv file, convert date columns, filter for Paris listings, and perform data QA (missing values, min/max/average checks).
✅ Create a summary table paris_listings_neighbourhood to show average prices by neighborhood, sorted from lowest to highest.
✅ Build the paris_listings_accommodations table for the most expensive neighborhood, grouped by accommodates, and sorted by average price.
✅ Generate the paris_listings_over_time table, showing yearly new host counts and average prices.
✅ Visualize trends using two line charts: one for new hosts over time and one for average prices—complete with custom axis formatting and titles.
✅ Challenge: Create a dual-axis line chart that overlays new host count and average price to observe trend correlations over time.
